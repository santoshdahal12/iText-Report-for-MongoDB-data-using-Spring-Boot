The application is a spring Boot app. It uses Spring Data for MongoDB data persistence.

It has a simple demonstartion for writing a pdf report using iText and JFree chart for Pie chart.

Please create a collection to see the effect of Mongo data persistence. If collection is not created , the data is still persisted in the log of mongo and you can see the details in the console.

Good Luck using Spring Boot, Mongo DB, iText and JFree chart.
